## Dev Project

This is a response to the coding test listed at the following repo:
https://github.com/clarkplanet/dev-test

I have decided to do the project in React

To Start:
  - CD into the directory
  - run an `npm install`
  - run `npm run start`
 
IF I was going to do this as a laravel project, I would:
 - Create all the required Eloquent models needed (Applicants, Jobs, and Skills)
 - Set up the relationships in those models (Applicants has one job, has many skills)
 - Run a join query using the ORM
 - Create a blade template to output the HTML of the page
